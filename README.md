This is a React-based web application that solves the **Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch Problem (UCDP)** using **Dynamic Programming**. The tool allows users to input generator parameters, define the required load, and compute the most cost-efficient power distribution across multiple generators.

## 🚀 Features

- Select up to 8 generators.
- Input generator constraints and cost function coefficients (`a`, `b`, `d`).
- Define required load (in MW).
- Calculates the optimal generation plan using DP.
- Displays the total generation cost and breakdown per generator.
